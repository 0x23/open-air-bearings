# Open Air Bearings
Welcome to the Open Air Bearings repository! This repository provides techniques and simulation software for air bearings. Open air bearings are mechanical devices that support components using a thin film of air, eliminating the need for solid contact and reducing friction to almost zero.

# Simulation

The simulation folder contains a small and simple python programs to simulate planar air bearings with grooves and pressure inlets from a given design provided as an image file and outputs:
1. A plot of the lift force vs gap height, allowing to optimize the design for stiffness and to select an optimal preload value.
2. The pressure distribution for a reference gap height as a false color image
3. The relative flow rates under the air bearing pad as a false color image
4. A animated gif of the pressure distribution for varying gap heights
